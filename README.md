# StackACream
Ice Cream Game
I decided to create this game because not only was it the simplest to make, it was also a game that allowed me to make it creative. We had
some technical issues and programming bugs here and there with some of the collisions with the objects, but we fixed those issues with the help of some youtube tutorials
and different coroutine methods. The story is that you tripped and fell on the road and lost your ice cream. You have to stack as many as you can and if you miss one, the
game is over
